# Skill Assessment Part 2

## Instructions

Please fork this repository on Github. Once you have done so, please pull down this repo into your local computer so you can edit the files in VSCode.

There are other instructions in each folder. You are tasked with fixing a backend server and finishing up a React application.
The backend server has 3 tasks that need to be completed and the react application only has 1 task.

Start with the backend server first. Once you have completed the backend server, you can start the react application. Everything has been created for you. You just need to fix bugs.

In each folder, make sure you run `npm install` so each project can get the dependencies they need to run. For the backend server, if you want to run it, run `npm run start` in the `movie-app-backend` folder. For the react application, run `npm run dev` to run the react application.

Both projects are dependent on each other. So to fetch from the backend server, make sure it is running. If it's not running, you will get no data at all.

Good Luck!
